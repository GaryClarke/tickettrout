            <h2>Your Tickets In One Click!</h2>
            <p><b>Would you be excited if you logged in to see this?</b> No scrambling around, inputting your new credit
                card details or hitting the refresh button 100 times only to find that the tickets have all been
                hoovered up and are selling on Vianono for Â£200+</p>

            <p><b>Is that all I need to do?</b> Yes, your details have already been verified and the tickets are yours.
                You've
                even got the time to message your friends and see who would like to go.
            </p>

            <p><b>How will I know if I am going to get tickets?</b> We will make every effort to get a full allocation
                for those who qualify and give you as much warning as possible that tickets are becoming available.
            </p>
            <p><b>What if I can't go?</b> All is not lost. By releasing the tickets early, you are giving others the
                chance to buy them at face value and we'll reward you with points. You get to feel good either way :)

                <b>Who benefits from this system?</b> This system benefits genuine fans because it's simple and
                convenient. It also benefits TicketTrout because we grow a loyal, returning customer base. The only
                people who are going to hate it are the touts....shame.
